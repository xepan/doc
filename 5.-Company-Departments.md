#HR >> Departments

This page lets you manage Departments in your company. It allows you to create Custom Departments, along with pre-defined basic Departments, as required in each and every company. You can define new Departments and manage them from here.

Its contains two sections for the purpose. Left section shows the list of all Departments in your company. Right section provides you with the options to manage the particular Department selected from Left section. 

On the top of Left Section, displays a label "Department\Production Phases". After that it provides a button with label "Add Department", which allows you to add a Custom Department for your company. On clicking the button, you will see a dialogue box (more technically, a Virtual Page), which will request for following information:
	Department/Phase:	
					The name of the new Department you want to create.
	Level			:	
					Defines the level of that Department in terms of its place with respect to other Departments in the Production Process.
					For Example: If the production of an Item goes through multiple stages, then each stage, to be defined as separate Departments, will be defined with the levels here. If two stages (now we will use the term departments instead) are mutually exclusive in their work, then they must be defined at same level so that item is allowed to go through only one of them, not the both.
	Is Active		:
					Its states whether the current department is active or not.
					
Next to the "Add Department" button, is the search box to find particular Department from the (long) list of Departments in your company.
And below is the list of all pre-defined and custom Departments you have defined as per your requirements.
